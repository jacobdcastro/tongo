# The `/components/pages` Directory

This directory holds all components that render content on specific pages across the app. The directory is organized by the type of page each component belongs to. The two types of pages are the different types that are created by the Next.js framework:

- static
- ssr

## The `pages/ssr` Directory

In development...

## The `pages/static` Directory

Components in `/static` are used by ALL static pages (events and venue pages).

Components in the root `/static` directory are shared between events and venue pages. Components in `/static/event` and `/static/venue` are specific to only the Event and Venue pages respectively.
